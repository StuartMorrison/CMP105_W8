Note to self- I'm an IDIOT, sat for an hour trying to get AABB to work, the whole time the velocity was continiously getting switched from
 positive to negative and vice versa every loop of level.update. I think was about to smack my nose into my face when I suggested looking at
 the warnings on visual studio as a last attempt before my soul which was clutching my body let go and i died while crying on this very seat.
 I had accidently put a semi colon at the end of the if statement which meant it was doing nothing and so kept calling the collision response.
 I dont know how i could be scanning code like no oine but also be more blind than daredevil.
